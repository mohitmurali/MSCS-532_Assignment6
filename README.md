# Assignment 6: Medians and Order Statistics & Elementary Data Structures

## Overview
This repository contains the solution to Assignment 6, implementing selection algorithms and elementary data structures in Python, along with a detailed report.

## Repository Structure
- `assignment_6_solution.py`: Python code for all implementations and tests.
- `report.md`: Detailed report with implementation, analysis, and discussion.
- `README.md`: This file.

## How to Run
1. **Requirements:** Python 3.x with standard libraries (random, time, statistics).
2. **Execution:**
   - Run `python assignment_6_solution.py` to execute the empirical tests and basic data structure demonstrations.
   - The script outputs empirical timing results for selection algorithms and test outputs for data structures.

## Summary of Findings
- **Selection Algorithms:** Randomized Quickselect is faster in practice, but Median of Medians offers consistency across input types.
- **Data Structures:** Arrays suit fixed-size, access-heavy tasks; linked lists excel in dynamic scenarios.
